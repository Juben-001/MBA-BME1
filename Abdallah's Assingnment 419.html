    <h1>Assignment One</h1>
    <P>My name is Mohammed Ben Abdallah. I'm offering biomedical engineering. I think this course has a great impact on humanity as a whole. Being a blend of medicine and engineering, biomedical engineers have the ability to create health equipment that can make healthcare better and more easily accessible. We may not operate on patients as surgeons, but indirectly we also save as many lives as they do: the first artificial organ made in 1963 was created by a biomedical engineer. His work has been built upon by numerous engineers to date, and breakthroughs in this field last forever. This is simply why I'd love to be one.
